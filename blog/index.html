							<p>What is information? Is it the bits and bytes that your computer uses to run, or the facts read in a textbook? According to Google, information is defined as “facts provided or learned about something or someone”. When we think about what information is one key aspect is the context with which it is presented. This context is what differentiates the number 5 in one paper from the number 5 in another.</p>
							<p>That in and of itself is a fascinating concept. How data can take on a whole new life in new contexts, and how it can spark completely different emotions based on where it comes from. I’m excited to see where this class goes and how the study of the science of information can lead to the world we are living in today. From its roots without computers and digital equipment to modern day Google giants, the field of information science is rapidly growing and changing. It is touching more and more of our daily lives and as a Computer Science major I feel it is more important than ever to learn about the foundations of this science. </p>

							<p>As we move closer towards an “internet of everything”, the importance of intuitive, easy­to­use applications and websites grows exponentially. An ever­-increasing amount of our daily lives revolves around connected devices and the internet but still, many turn a blind eye to the notion of user experience. While the tides are turning, many of the biggest applications in crucial fields are lacking the necessary tools to be able to do their jobs in a quicker, more effective, and most importantly, safer manner. This is not to say, however, that work is not being done to combat these issues. An army of designers and developers has formed to bring these issues to light and offer their knowledge to analyze data and move the web forward.</p>
						<p>The eye is one of the most versatile tools in design. With it we can create stunning visual experiences that captivate users and make them feel immersed in the application. With its great power come drawbacks, and this same tool that can make a user feel immersed can also be the cause for frustration when our eyes fail to see the next step to complete the task at hand. Poor design not only makes applications seem no help at all, but it makes users blame themselves as well. The nuances of design such as color, size, and layout end up having a profound impact on the users of software. So who is right when they say a feature should be implemented in a certain way? As humans with varying preferences and tastes, whose opinions should reign supreme in the ongoing debate of user experience and design?</p>
						<p>From a bird’s eye view, the idea of user experience seems simple. Provide a way for users to interact with websites and apps in order to accomplish a specific task. Looking more closely, we find that the ‘correct’ way to design and implement these applications is not only difficult to perceive, but also has been subject to the opinions and choices made from designers of old. Only recently have studies and surveys attempted to capture an understanding of how to design applications in order to make users feel comfortable and able to accomplish the task. Take for example the design element of carousels in websites. An emergent trend of putting information in a scrolling fashion on the homepage of websites has taken the internet by storm, but few have stopped to ask the glaring question­ does it actually work? According to Jared Smith, an accessibility expert, carousels are useful for telling senior executives that their information made it to the homepage but in reality only 1% of users actually interact with the carousel [1]. When designing a layout choices are made with regards to which features, colors, text sizes, and layouts to use. In order to make better choices when designing there needs to be a more structured and quantified way to understand which choices make for a better experience. Without this, we are left to debate which designer thinks they have the best solution for the problem without any actual evidence to support their claim.</p>
						<p>In "The Effects of Menu Design on Users' Emotions, Search Performance and Mouse Behaviour,” a group of academics make one such attempt at quantifying user experience by attempting to understand the effects of the menu design on user’s emotions . By taking a scientific approach to a user experience question the cycle of designing applications the way everyone else does is broken. This also allows for the quantitative reasoning of designing a feature, in this case the menu, in a certain way. Their attempts to reason about a majority case of users, and not personal opinion allow for readers and designers to use the data gathered to make educated choices about design. This can be seen in their statistical analysis of the data collected throughout their tests with users. Instead of making a broad claim about what is better or worse, they provide the mathematical likelihood of a user being happy when certain design elements are chosen. As noted, there is no one­size fits all or holy grail of design that will make all users happy, but there are some choices that clearly have an impact on the feeling a user has when using an application [2].</p>
						<p>While the aim of the document may not be to get designers to stop what they are doing and use what was learned to implement the menu, it does allow for questions to be asked about design decisions and data to back up its conclusions. It changes the debate from opinions or experience to data collected from surveys and samples. It aims to be a resource to provide for what may seem at first to be simple decisions, but in reality even simple decisions need their basis in something more concrete than the experience of another designer. By studying the effects different choices have on the way a user feels when using an application, the authors are making a valiant attempt to educate the creators of the applications we all know and love to take more care in the choices that are made.</p> <p>Does this mean all the designs and layouts we have encountered as users of the web is bad? The answer is a resounding no, unless you find yourself cursing at every website for its lack of intuitiveness. Because we have been pushed to doing more and more of our everyday tasks on the web and mobile platform there has been noticeable improvement in the ease of use of applications. All one would need to do is view the history of design iterations an application such as Facebook has undergone in just the past few years. The reality is, user experience and design is a rapidly changing concept. Through the efforts of those like the authors of the article the space of user design is becoming more defined in the general case by data and statistics. With this, designers and engineers can make better, quicker choices when building the applications that run our lives, and in turn, make us all happier when using them.</p>

							<p>Imagine opening up the web browser on your phone, navigating to your favorite news site, and then not being able to see any of the headlines. This would be considered a bug in any kind of application or web service. Furthermore, it would be considered a bad user experience. Now take it one step further and instead of trying to navigate the page as you normally would, you are only allowed to us the DOM tree shown by the web browser. The confusion that would arise from even some of the biggest web applications such as Facebook and Twitter would be enough to make you not want to come back if the only way to navigate was to sift through the mess of the source code.</p>
							<p>The most common way for visually impaired users to surf the web and use the internet is through screen readers. These text-to-speech applications allow for the reading of the text that is on the page. But what about videos, images, and other dynamic content? If you take a website like Facebook for example and try to consciously keep track of how you browse and interact with it you will find that it is much more complex that just a scrolling page of text. There are menus at the top, left, and right sides of the page along with posts, notifications, and more. This information overload is enough to cause our eyes strain from trying to take it all in, but imagine having to sift through the page only being able to hear the text. Perhaps the item being sought is a few hundred lines into the page. In an age where there are weeks spent trying to optimize API requests to gain an extra hundred milliseconds, making a user sift through hundreds of lines before getting the information they are looking for almost seems backwards.</p>
							<p>Does this mean that we should start writing our applications to contain less and less information? While an argument can be made for going minimal and the benefits of having users less distracted by other items on the page, this is too unrealistic. The notion that Facebook would rewrite itself to be more user-friendly to the visually impaired is just not feasible. That said, there are techniques that these users use in order to make the experience more pleasant for them. By understanding these techniques and attempting to cater these use cases better towards these types of users one can make using their application a more pleasant experience.</p>

							<p>As someone exposed to programming and a few different languages over the years, when the topic of R came up I became excited to try it out. I’ve heard some good things about the language and how it is poised and becoming one of the most widely adopted and used languages in the business world. </p>
							<p>This excitement began to fade and wore off after coming up against the wall of R in the assignment on exponential regressions. It seemed that every time I wanted to pull my knowledge of programming in to help solve the problem at hand I was faced with weird edge cases and incorrect behavior. That coupled with the fact that every time I would google a question I had or an example to see I would be faced with a number of different answers.</p>
							<p>This experience seems to have been similar to others as I ended up coming across a blog post written by Tal Yarkoni about the wonderfully verbose syntax of R. The ability to do the same task multiple ways may look like a blessing but in reality it can be the very thing that trips up newcomers to R and programming in general.</p>

							<p>In the past few years, data visualization has been a hot topic. As a society we are becoming more and more fascinated by the ability to understand the wealth of information we have access to. The hurdle that always remained was the ease at which the information can be understood. This is where visualization comes in.</p>
							<p>The best data visualizations are the ones that are easiest to understand with very little domain knowledge. Being able to glance at a chart or graph and garner the main points the author was trying to make has become an art-form in today’s day and age. So much so, that there are groups spawned in order to collect and admire the various successful, beautiful, attempts at such visualizations.</p>
							<p>One of my favorite visualizations is from Mailchimp who analyze, crunch, and beautifully display their annual year in review.</p>

							<p>The Internet. We all need it. So why not help make it accessible and available to everyone? This treasure trove of information only beginning to be analyzed could be the key to unlocking so many of today's mysteries.</p>
	
							<p>Code is just text on a computer. Ones and zeros in sequence that means nothing to the average Joe. The language of computers that knit the fine blanket we all share in the world wide web. But code can do so much more. Code can solve problems. Code can bring information to life. Information that can touch people's lives. Information that can bring people together.</p>

							<p>Ever since I started learning how to code I've been fascinated with how it can help make live's easier. But the prerequisite to writing good code is the ability to understand the information that you're dealing with. What good is the code you write if it cannot make the information you've worked hard to understand and decode morea available to everyone around you. But there's a problem.</p>

							<p>All code is bad.<a href="http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">*</a></p>

							<p>It's not that we aren't capable of writing good code. The reality is that we live in a time where everything happens in the moment. Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram. They all provide ways for us to share a moment of the stories we call our lives. But sometimes when we move along at the speed of life there are certain things, features, or people, that get left behind. We move so fast hacking our way through reality that we become blind to the treasures that the information we sit on has locked inside.</p>
							
							<p>But this semester's work is just a start. It's whetting my appetite for what I hope the future holds. I can write code, I can solve problems, but most rewarding of all, I can make people happy and bring them together. That's all I really want and can do: make people happy by making one more part of their day a little less stressful.</p>
