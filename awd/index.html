						<p>As we move closer towards an “internet of everything”, the importance of intuitive, easy­to­use applications and websites grows exponentially. An ever­-increasing amount of our daily lives revolves around connected devices and the internet but still, many turn a blind eye to the notion of user experience. While the tides are turning, many of the biggest applications in crucial fields are lacking the necessary tools to be able to do their jobs in a quicker, more effective, and most importantly, safer manner. This is not to say, however, that work is not being done to combat these issues. An army of designers and developers has formed to bring these issues to light and offer their knowledge to help those who are in need of it.</p>
						<p>The eye is one of the most versatile tools in design. With it we can create stunning visual experiences that captivate users and make them feel immersed in the application. With its great power come drawbacks, and this same tool that can make a user feel immersed can also be the cause for frustration when our eyes fail to see the next step to complete the task at hand. Poor design not only makes applications seem no help at all, but it makes users blame themselves as well. The nuances of design such as color, size, and layout end up having a profound impact on the users of software. So who is right when they say a feature should be implemented in a certain way? As humans with varying preferences and tastes, whose opinions should reign supreme in the ongoing debate of user experience and design?</p>
						<p>From a bird’s eye view, the idea of user experience seems simple. Provide a way for users to interact with websites and apps in order to accomplish a specific task. Looking more closely, we find that the ‘correct’ way to design and implement these applications is not only difficult to perceive, but also has been subject to the opinions and choices made from designers of old. Only recently have studies and surveys attempted to capture an understanding of how to design applications in order to make users feel comfortable and able to accomplish the task. Take for example the design element of carousels in websites. An emergent trend of putting information in a scrolling fashion on the homepage of websites has taken the internet by storm, but few have stopped to ask the glaring question­ does it actually work? According to Jared Smith, an accessibility expert, carousels are useful for telling senior executives that their information made it to the homepage but in reality only 1% of users actually interact with the carousel [1]. When designing a layout choices are made with regards to which features, colors, text sizes, and layouts to use. In order to make better choices when designing there needs to be a more structured and quantified way to understand which choices make for a better experience. Without this, we are left to debate which designer thinks they have the best solution for the problem without any actual evidence to support their claim.</p>
						<p>In "The Effects of Menu Design on Users' Emotions, Search Performance and Mouse Behaviour,” a group of academics make one such attempt at quantifying user experience by attempting to understand the effects of the menu design on user’s emotions . By taking a scientific approach to a user experience question the cycle of designing applications the way everyone else does is broken. This also allows for the quantitative reasoning of designing a feature, in this case the menu, in a certain way. Their attempts to reason about a majority case of users, and not personal opinion allow for readers and designers to use the data gathered to make educated choices about design. This can be seen in their statistical analysis of the data collected throughout their tests with users. Instead of making a broad claim about what is better or worse, they provide the mathematical likelihood of a user being happy when certain design elements are chosen. As noted, there is no one­size fits all or holy grail of design that will make all users happy, but there are some choices that clearly have an impact on the feeling a user has when using an application [2].</p>
						<p>While the aim of the document may not be to get designers to stop what they are doing and use what was learned to implement the menu, it does allow for questions to be asked about design decisions and data to back up its conclusions. It changes the debate from opinions or experience to data collected from surveys and samples. It aims to be a resource to provide for what may seem at first to be simple decisions, but in reality even simple decisions need their basis in something more concrete than the experience of another designer. By studying the effects different choices have on the way a user feels when using an application, the authors are making a valiant attempt to educate the creators of the applications we all know and love to take more care in the choices that are made.</p> <p>Does this mean all the designs and layouts we have encountered as users of the web is bad? The answer is a resounding no, unless you find yourself cursing at every website for its lack of intuitiveness. Because we have been pushed to doing more and more of our everyday tasks on the web and mobile platform there has been noticeable improvement in the ease of use of applications. All one would need to do is view the history of design iterations an application such as Facebook has undergone in just the past few years. The reality is, user experience and design is a rapidly changing concept. Through the efforts of those like the authors of the article the space of user design is becoming more defined in the general case by data and statistics. With this, designers and engineers can make better, quicker choices when building the applications that run our lives, and in turn, make us all happier when using them.</p>

							<p>The web in its fullest capacity should be accessible and available at the same level to everyone. In the field of web development, the notion of designing experiences as mobile and desktop friendly is highly emphasized to the point that many applications are now being developed with a mobile-first approach. This leads to better accessibility from a device standpoint but rarely are the varying types of users taken into consideration. When the term accessibility is used in the realm of web-based applications, often the first thing to come to mind is device support. As more and more web traffic is shifting towards mobile and tablet devices this becomes an understandable conclusion to draw but what part of the web is it ignoring?</p>
							<p>As web developers, we pride ourselves on our ability to have an impact on the users of our applications. Solving problems that save time and leave users happy are a few of the reasons that we continuously stare at the computer screens day after day typing the code that makes up those solutions.</p>
							<p>Imagine opening up the web browser on your phone, navigating to your favorite news site, and then not being able to see any of the headlines. This would be considered a bug in any kind of application or web service. Furthermore, it would be considered a bad user experience. Now take it one step further and instead of trying to navigate the page as you normally would, you are only allowed to us the DOM tree shown by the web browser. The confusion that would arise from even some of the biggest web applications such as Facebook and Twitter would be enough to make you not want to come back if the only way to navigate was to sift through the mess of the source code.</p>
							<p>The most common way for visually impaired users to surf the web and use the internet is through screen readers. These text-to-speech applications allow for the reading of the text that is on the page. But what about videos, images, and other dynamic content? If you take a website like Facebook for example and try to consciously keep track of how you browse and interact with it you will find that it is much more complex that just a scrolling page of text. There are menus at the top, left, and right sides of the page along with posts, notifications, and more. This information overload is enough to cause our eyes strain from trying to take it all in, but imagine having to sift through the page only being able to hear the text. Perhaps the item being sought is a few hundred lines into the page. In an age where there are weeks spent trying to optimize API requests to gain an extra hundred milliseconds, making a user sift through hundreds of lines before getting the information they are looking for almost seems backwards.</p>
							<p>Does this mean that we should start writing our applications to contain less and less information? While an argument can be made for going minimal and the benefits of having users less distracted by other items on the page, this is too unrealistic. The notion that Facebook would rewrite itself to be more user-friendly to the visually impaired is just not feasible. That said, there are techniques that these users use in order to make the experience more pleasant for them. By understanding these techniques and attempting to cater these use cases better towards these types of users one can make using their application a more pleasant experience.</p>
							<p>One possible solution may be to start hacking on screen readers and improving them to be smarter, faster, and better. While this makes sense in theory, it is not likely that many web developers have the time, drive, or domain knowledge to do so. The doors are open for those that do, however, as many of the applications are open-source and available to start improving upon. These programs just waiting for the community that has built the likes of Linux, Apache Spark, D3.js and so many other incredible technologies to bring the internet to the visually impaired. Some of these applications are closely integrated with most modern browsers in an attempt to make the web a more navigable experience for visually impaired users. As a developer the concept of use cases are important to understand how users will interact with what we build. Instead of turning a blind eye to the visually impaired, developers should re-evaluate the need for understanding how these applications are built in order to better serve a wider audience.</p>
							<p>With this in mind, the first step to producing a more encompassing web is knowledge. As a developer, when faced with a problem the likely first step is to understand the issue in its entirety in order to come up with the most optimal solution. Without an understanding of the current situation of the interactions of the visually impaired with the web, the possibility of working towards a better future for them is less probable. How can a problem be solved when those capable of doing so cannot see the importance or relevancy of that problem to their work? A simple way to understand the situation is to come to know how screen readers work. By essentially ‘figuring out’ what is on the page, a screen reader will attempt to speak the content to the user. This includes navigation links, paragraphs of text, menus, as well as images. Readers attempt to extract the relevant information from the tags that build up the web page. When these tags fail to be completed with the information necessary for the readers it results in a poor experience. Imagine having a hole in the page where a picture once was, for thirty percent of the visitors of the application.</p>
							<p>In a similar way to how developers write code that will work in multiple browsers, care should also be given to writing code that is interpreted correctly by not only browsers, but screen readers. At first it may seem a daunting task to support yet another piece of software, bringing back the horrible memories of supporting old versions of IE. A daunting task indeed, until it is understood the ease with which it can be done. It boils down to simply adding descriptive information to our tags when writing HTML. Have a picture? Add the ‘alt’ attribute that screen readers will read in order to give context to the image. Have a button? Add the ‘aria- role’ attribute to help screen readers understand what the button is for. If the ‘aria- x’ label looks familiar then what you may not know is the ARIA standard is a way to improve accessibility. These labels are present in some of the biggest framework foundations like Bootstrap, and all that is left is for developers to continue adding these attributes when adding new tags to the HTML pages. Once an understanding of how screen readers interact with our pages, and how the boilerplates we use day to day already lay the foundation to improve accessibility it makes improving the situation much more attainable. As developers, we can improve the web for the visually impaired one HTML tag at a time.</p>
							<p>If editing and remembering to add attributes to the HTML tags is still too much, then hidden in the way developers are beginning to tackle the changing web is another solution to the problem. When we think about designing a mobile- friendly application, much thought is given to how we can slim these pages down in order to give the user the most relevant information within the limited space. Another tactic used by the visually impaired is to browse the mobile versions of websites for the very same reason. Mobile presents slimmed down versions of the pages, with handpicked information the developer thought essential to get across to the user. The conversation about mobile presents a prime opportunity to weave in a discussion of those users who are visually impaired. With minimal additional effort, these users can not only be added into the equation, but developers can tweak the code they are already writing to be mobile friendly to be screen reader friendly as well. By doing so developers are not only writing applications and code that will be useful for the short-term mobile craze but will also get a head start on being ready for the added traffic of the visually impaired.</p>
							<p>While most developers are eager to design for the future, few are asking the question about what the future of web development will look like. As of now, mobile is the trend but what else will the future hold? A growing number of disabled users are gaining access to the web with advancing technology. The sooner developers are able to cater their applications to these new emerging users, the sooner the web will be the all-encompassing space designers and developers set out to make it. A profound impact can be made to improve the experience of the visually impaired with little changes to the way developers build their applications. The time is now to improve the web making it more accessible and in turn, making the internet a better place to learn, grow, and enjoy.</p>

							<p>Remember that game where your task is to guide a blindfolded person around the room, avoiding obstacles, trying to get to the target? Even though we might not have been able to see anything, we trusted in the words of the one guiding us that we wouldn’t hit the wall or fall over some object. Without our sight for those brief moments, we learn to navigate by listening. Using the words to paint a mental picture of where our next move will take us, piecing together the world one small bit at a time.</p>
							<p>It may not come as a surprise that for the visually impaired the go-to way to browse and use the web is through listening. Letting the web pages speak to them in order to guide them through to the information they seek. In a vacuum, this may seem like a simple task. But remember, it was a game back then. You and your team against others with everyone fighting each other for the attention of their teammate. Now filtering the noise of the environment out has added a new dimension of complexity to your task. While the web page being visited contains the information being sought after, it could also contain lots of other information.</p>
							<p>To the credit of those whose use screen readers every day, some have become proficient in their traversal of information. They are able to navigate the page with speed and agility locating what they are after. While this may be the case for frequently visited sites and pages, it would not be the norm. Going to a new page would be like stepping into a new room. The first task is to listen for the obstacles, and find the path to your goal.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, the majority of software being created today does little to aid those trying to navigate in this way. Take, for example, trying to help someone with their eyes closed navigate Facebook. It might take you a few tries to understand what they are trying to do, but in the end you’ll ignore the newsfeed if all that’s important to the user is checking their notifications. At this stage, the screen readers used are not smart enough to skip over irrelevant information, relying on the user to manually skip over blocks. Imagine listening to the positions of each and every obstacle in the room, some relevant, others just adding to the information overload. Not only is it frustrating, but also time consuming. There must be a better way.</p>
							<p>Most of us are surrounded by software in our daily lives, and whether we realize or not we are actually involved in the creation of software. It may not be the next Facebook, but when others or we create or order a blog or new website, e- commerce store, or mobile application we are contributing to the software eco- system. When we have the ability to influence the path a piece of software takes then why not help it reach more users? Have an e-commerce site and are interested in reaching another third of all web users? Ask how well your site does at being accessible to those who are visually impaired. By adding to the conversation surrounding accessibility, you too can have a positive impact without writing a single line of code.</p>
							<p>The potential outcome is incredible, and attainable. Imagine an internet that is able to understand what we’re looking for, or which piece of information we’re after. We can come blindfolded into a brand new room, and our guide is able to understand not only our intent, but will give the best possible route eliminating the noise that is irrelevant.</p> 
							<p>Seems impossible.</p>
							<p>Impossible, until you understand the amazing things software is already doing. We live in an age where we can teach a computer to play Jeopardy through machine learning. This same technique teaches a computer to see what you put in your fridge, and notify you when it’ll expire or spoil. And with this same technique, we can teach our guide to understand our goal when visiting a web page or using an application. All this, leads to a better, more inclusive internet, an internet that is truly for all.</p>

							<p>The Internet. We all need it. So why not help make it accessible and available to everyone?</p>
							<p>The Spring 2016 semester started with just a simple question. Why should this treasure trove of information and productivity ehancer we call the internet be exclusive?</p>

							<p>It shouldn't.</p>

							<p>Code is just text on a computer. Ones and zeros in sequence that means nothing to the average Joe. The language of computers that knit the fine blanket we all share in the world wide web. But code can do so much more. Code can solve problems. Code can touch people's lives. Code can bring people together.</p>

							<p>Ever since I started learning how to code I've been fascinated with how it can help make live's easier. It turns out that even with this fascination, finding a topic to write about throughout the semester was not an easy task. After pondering over the reasons why I and other developers spend hours typing away at the computer I realized that there was something missing.</p>

							<p>Design and development revolves around the idea of iteration and refinement. While I was familiar with the concept in the programming world, I found the ability to go back, edit, change, and iterate over my writing to be equally rewarding. As in software, this process can be done alone but the real benefit comes with collaboration. Combining ideas is what made my writing better, but it is also what makes the code we write better, and by extension the internet. And that's important.</p>

							<p>All code is bad.<a href="http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">*</a></p>

							<p>It's not that we aren't capable of writing good code. The reality is that we live in a time where everything happens in the moment. Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram. They all provide ways for us to share a moment of the stories we call our lives. But sometimes when we move along at the speed of life there are certain things, features, or people, that get left behind. We move so fast hacking our way through reality that we become blind to those who want nothing more then to share in our enjoyment of the moment.</p>

							<p>Through the writings and research that filled these past few months I've come to realize that while we've come an astonishingly long way from just a decade ago it might be time to take a step back. Instead of hacking our way through the moment let's turn around and make sure that we're not only moving ourselves forward but also those around us. In the end what we can accomplish alone is not nearly as impressive as what we can accomplish together.</p>
							
							<p>But this semester's work is just a start. It's whetting my appetite for what I hope the future holds. I can write code, I can solve problems, but most rewarding of all, I can make people happy and bring them together. That's all I really want and can do: make people happy by making one more part of their day a little less stressful.</p>
